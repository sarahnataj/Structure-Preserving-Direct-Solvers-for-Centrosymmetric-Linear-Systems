Abstract: 	We consider structure-preserving LU-type factorizations for centrosymmetric and skew--centrosymmetric matrices. We build on existing algorithms and complement the factorizations with equilibration and mixed-precision computations. We apply the solvers to linear systems arising from spectral discretizations of model problems and demonstrate their effectiveness.
